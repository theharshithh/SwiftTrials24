# Swift Trials

Welcome to Swift Trials, a comprehensive tool for managing and analyzing SMILES data with a focus on toxicity assessment and patient flagging.

## Features

### 1. Toxicity Report for SMILES
Generate detailed toxicity reports for SMILES data. Identify potential toxic compounds and assess their impact with our sophisticated analysis tools.

### 2. Patient Flagging
Flag patients based on specific criteria to highlight potential issues or concerns. Improve patient management and streamline decision-making processes. Input patient report and get complete information about the patient for drug files.

### 3. SMILES Similarity Score
Calculate SMILES similarity scores to measure the resemblance between chemical structures. Identify similarities and differences to support various research and analysis tasks.

## Future Plans
In the future, we plan to incorporate AI to simulate all parameters once we have enough data.
